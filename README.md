# Stock-Analysis With Excel VBA 
## Overview of Project 
### Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to help students understand how does refactoring a code help improve the overall speed and performance in excel VBA. In this assignment we are refactoring the code for 2017 and 2018 years that will help us determine whether or not certain stocks are worth investing. The previous code allowed us to determine just that, but for the purpose of refactoring we are creating a more efficient and faster code time response in VBA. 

### Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Comparing 2017- and 2018-year stocks we can determine that 2017 had a better overall stock investment portfolio than compared to 2018. The year 2017 stocks investment had 11/12 stocks have a positive return on investment with only one stock having a negative return. The code for the year 2017 ran incredibly faster taking only ¼ of the second it took to run originally. The year 2017 compared to 2018 is a better stock investment return for Steve to recommend to his parents.

The stocks investment for the year 2018 had a lot of negative return on investment. 10/12 of the stocks all yield substantial negative returns and only two had a positive return of investment. The refactored code for the year 2018 did however run incredibly faster than its original code. The code ran at 0.22 seconds compared to 1.2 seconds of its original code.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
### 1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? 
The advantages of refactoring a code in VBA is that its response time is a lot faster and efficient. Refactoring a code allows VBA to use less memory and improve the logic of the code so that future users can better understand the key elements of the code. The disadvantage of refactoring a code in VBA is while it may run at a faster time using less memory, this could become insufficient because key data maybe excluded. Refactoring large data sets can pose a risk because each data sets has its unique codes and refactoring can eliminate some key data that were originally there. 
### 2.	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The Pros and Cons of refactoring the original VBA script really depends on what data you are refactoring. Not ever data can be refactored. The pros of refactoring a data would be hat it makes the code cleaner and more organized. It allows VBA to run faster time programming. It becomes easier to read for new and future users. It’s also concise and straightforward allowing the user to see how the data is compared to previous years and how to determine for example what stocks performed had a great return investment and what did not. 
While there are quite a few pros there is also a couple cons that go with refactoring. Not all data can have the luxury of being refactored because of how large a data set is. Refactoring runs on less memory and so this might pose a risk for large data sets that may exclude certain data.
